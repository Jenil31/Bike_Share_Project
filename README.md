## Goal


This project is the final project of MSAN697 Distributed Data System. In this project we used ML algorithms and s3, MongoDB, spark, AWS to predict Bay Area bike share daily demand. In the presentation slides, we also showed our result to compare the 
performance of executing modeling.py (the model pipline file) on local machine and on aws standalone cluster.


The learning outcome of this project is to understand the application of spark ML, cloud data pipline construction and cost efficiency in big data implementation. 



## Description of Data


The dataset we will be analyzing in this study is from the kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share/data)

The data includes information about Anonymized bike trip data from August 2013 to August 2015 with tables: station, weather, trip, status. 


## Presentation slides


The Presentation slides is a complete demonstration of the discussion and summary of the prediction as well as evaluation.
